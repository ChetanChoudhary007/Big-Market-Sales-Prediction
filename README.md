## Introduction

The "Big Market Sales Prediction" project aims to predict sales in a market dataset using machine learning. The XGBoost regression algorithm is employed for this purpose.

## Dependencies

The project code uses the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- xgboost

## Dataset

The project use dataset: `Train.csv`, These datasets contain information about items, outlets, and sales in a market.

## Data Analysis and Cleaning

- The datasets are loaded using `pandas`.
- Null values in the datasets are identified and handled using means for numerical features and modes for categorical features.
- Categorical data is explored, and data cleaning is performed, including standardizing values like `Item_Fat_Content`.

## Data Preprocessing

- Categorical features are encoded using `LabelEncoder` to prepare them for the machine learning model.
- The datasets are split into input (`X`) and output (`y`) datasets.
- The data is further split into training and testing datasets using `train_test_split`.

## Model Training

The machine learning model used for this project is the XGBoost regression algorithm. The model is trained using the training dataset.

## Results

- The accuracy of the model is evaluated using the R-squared score.
- Accuracy is measured for both the training and testing datasets.
- The model is trained using the entire dataset and tested again to see its performance on the full data.

## Conclusion

The "Big Market Sales Prediction" project successfully predicts sales in a market dataset using the XGBoost regression algorithm. By following data analysis, preprocessing, and model training steps, the project demonstrates how to approach sales prediction tasks in a real-world scenario.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it for further experimentation and improvements.
